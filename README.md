# NAME

DBIx::Class::Helper::Row::Types - Use Types to define rows

# VERSION

version v0.4.0

# SYNOPSIS

In result class:

```perl
 use Types::SQL -types;
 use Types::Standard -types;

__PACKAGE__->load_components('Helper::Row::Types');

__PACKAGE__->add_columns(

   id   => Serial,

   name => {
     isa => Maybe[ Varchar[64] ],
   },
);
```

# DESCRIPTION

This helper allows you to specify column information by passing a
[Type::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Type%3A%3ATiny) object.

Note that this _does not_ enforce that the data is of that type,
unless you specify the `strict` option (See ["set\_column"](#set_column)).  The
main purpose of this is to allow you to use types as a shorthand for
specifying the column type.

You can use types from [Types::SQL](https://metacpan.org/pod/Types%3A%3ASQL) or supported types from
[Types::Standard](https://metacpan.org/pod/Types%3A%3AStandard).  See [Types::SQL::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Types%3A%3ASQL%3A%3AUtil) for more details.

# METHODS

## `add_column`

## `add_columns`

These methods are modified to allow you to specify the column info
using the `isa` attribute and a [Type::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Type%3A%3ATiny) type.

Note that in no way does this enforce that type.

## `set_column`

If the `strict` attribute is true for the column, then the type
constraint will be enforced when the column is explicitly set.

If the `coerce` attribute is true, then the type's coercion will be
applied before checking the constraint.

Note that type constraints will not be enforced if you use the
`insert` or resultset `create` methods.

This is entirely separate from database-level constraints.

Enabling `strict` for an inflated column is strongly discouraged.

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.4.0, the this module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten years.

If you need this module on Perl v5.10, please use one of the v0.3.x
versions of this module.  Significant bug or security fixes may be
backported to those versions.

# KNOWN ISSUES

Strict type constraints are only applied when explicitly setting a
column value.
